// Cairo contract for prediction markets, using the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) as the market maker.
// We have a single market maker contract that can create multiple markets, each with its own set of outcomes.
// The market maker contract is responsible for keeping track of the total amount of money in the market, and the amount of money in each outcome.
// The contract also keeps track of the current price of each outcome, which is calculated using the LMSR formula.
// The contract allows users to buy and sell shares of each outcome, and calculates the new price of each outcome after each trade.
// Shares in the market are represented as ERC20 tokens, which can be used to claim winnings.
// The contract also allows users to resolve the market, which locks in the final outcome and distributes the money to the winning traders.
// The contract is implemented in Cairo, and can be deployed on the StarkNet network.
